•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was the client for this project.  The Gaming Room has a game, Draw It or Lose It, currently available in an Android app only.  The Gaming Room would like for us to develop this game into a web-based game that serves multiple platforms.  

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I don't think I did anything particularly well in developing this documentation.  My inexperience with development showed in my inability to even consider all the design constraints, software development considerations, and even in evaluating the various platforms for their strengths and weaknesses.  I don't believe that I even knew enough to ask the right questions to get to the right answers.  

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I did find the UML diagram helpful in developing the code.  

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably revise the software development considerations.  I think this is where I probably did the worst on this document.  To improve it, I would research a little more thoroughly what exactly those considerations entail.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs as being able to access the current game app no matter what platform they are running.  It is important to consider their needs because this is what the client wants.  They want their game to expand just beyond the Android market.  

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
How I approached it for this project was mostly to think about and research what each portion of the document needed and then searching for answers online.  In the future, I think I would do much the same, but would research more thoroughly and perhaps see if I could get some pointers from more experienced software designers.  I know that this is the weaker side of my experience, and I need to not run away from it, but make my skills in this area stronger.
